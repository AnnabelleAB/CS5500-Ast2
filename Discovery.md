## Description

Discovery: When a team undertakes a new task the first step in the process is often called Discovery. The outcome of the discovery stage is a high-level plan of how to solve the problem. In this particular exercise we want you to produce a document that outlines how your team is going to address tackling the three sub-projects. This document should be your plan of action. Your discovery/plan-of action document will be reviewed by your scrum master. This is mandatory and highly useful.

## How our team is going to address tackling the three sub-projects ( plan of out action.)

### Part1

### Part2

### Part3
In Part 3 of our project, we are tasked with enhancing the user experience by developing a feature that displays the name of the user editing a cell in real-time, ensuring seamless collaboration and interaction within our shared spreadsheet application.
It involves several steps.
1. Understanding the System: Review SpreadSheetController.ts and understand current data flow.
2. Gap Analysis: Identify missing data needed to show who’s editing.
3. Data Modification: Update backend to send editor's information to frontend.
4. Frontend Update: Adjust frontend to receive and display editor’s info on the cell.
5. Testing: Test new feature for functionality and user experience.
6. Documentation: Document changes and update user instructions.
7. Feedback & Iteration: Collect feedback and refine the feature.

### Part0 
These sub-project aim to document and visualize the codebase's architecture, flows, and components. 
*Codebase Architecture Diagram*  *Database Schema Diagram* *Component Interaction Diagram* *Front-end Flowchart* *Back-end Flowchart* *Sequence Diagrams*
1. Start with an initial meeting to discuss the scope and objectives of creating a codebase architecture diagram.
2. Gather the findings from our retro-engineering efforts, including insights about the system's components, interactions, and data flows.
3. Decide on the type of diagram that best represents the codebase's architecture. Common options include system architecture diagrams, component diagrams, or flowcharts.
4. Begin drafting the architecture diagram based on the collected data. Use visualization tools Lucidchart.
5. Share the initial draft with team members for feedback and suggestions. Ensure that the diagram accurately reflects the codebase's structure and logic.
6. Accompany the diagram with documentation that explains key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other.
