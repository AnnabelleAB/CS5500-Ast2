## What worked well for your team
1. Early Planning and Timeline: We started off on the right foot by having our initial meeting early in the project and setting a clear timeline. This helped us get organized and know exactly when we need to achieve specific project milestones.
2. GitHub Efficiency: We've been making the most of GitHub's features, like branches, to prevent any code conflicts. This has made our code collaboration much smoother and reduced the chances of issues cropping up during integration.
3. Staged Communication: We've been having meetings at different stages of the project to share ideas and stay in touch regularly. It's been a great way to keep everyone informed and foster collaboration.
4. Even Work Distribution: We've managed to distribute the workload evenly among team members, and it's paid off. Everyone's been delivering their part effectively, which keeps the project moving forward steadily.
